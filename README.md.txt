# 🎓 Exam Results Analysis (SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs an SQL-based analysis of student exam scores using a dataset of students' performance in Math, Reading, and Writing. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights related to gender, parental education, lunch status, and test preparation courses, and how these factors influence academic performance.

## 📂 Files Included

- `exams analysis.sql` – SQL queries used for data exploration and analysis.
- `exams.csv` – Raw dataset containing students' scores and demographic information.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- PostgreSQL / MySQL (adapt SQL accordingly)
- Microsoft Excel / CSV
- Git & GitHub

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

- Average scores by gender
- Comparison of performance based on parental level of education
- Impact of lunch type (standard vs free/reduced) on scores
- Correlation between test preparation course and subject performance
- Overall performance distribution across subjects

## 📊 Sample Questions Answered

- Do students who complete a test preparation course perform better?
- Are there score differences between male and female students?
- Does the level of parental education influence student performance?

## 🧠 Key Insights (Example Results)

> Replace with actual findings from your SQL output:
- Students who completed test preparation scored on average **15–20% higher** across all subjects.
- Female students outperformed male students in Reading and Writing, while males slightly led in Math.
- Higher parental education levels are associated with better student performance, especially in Writing.
